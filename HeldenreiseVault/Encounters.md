For monsters, I use forge of foes principles. I don't give them a full character sheet with attributes and all. I use a standard table giving me AC, HP, DPR, number of attacks and I use forge of foes to decide how many bosses, regular and minion monsters to put in an encounter. you can use "monster template" for a template on how to present monsters, you an use the existing monsters and forge of foes for ideas on capacities to give monsters, I wan minions to only have simple attaque and maybe 1 passive or 1 special action they will use once in a fight I want regular monsters to have 1 default attack, at least 1 fun reaction or passive and at least 1 special attack to give them flavor, it does not need to be very powerful, it needs to be flavorful I want bosses to have 1 default attack, 1 passive, 1 special attaque and 1 reaction and 2 special things that are either a passive or a reaction or a special attack, I want bosses to be dangerous and always have very flavorful abilities that synergize and to induce a particular encounter type, using mmorpg special boss tactics as base ideas (ie, can we make a boss fight that mimics Onyxia, or can we mimic fighting the twins in An'Qiraj, ...)

When I want you to give me ideas of patrol encounters and boss fights: give me the number and type of ennemis, a description for each following the template and explanation on how to run the encounter and what power/combination of powers makes for a fun encounter
