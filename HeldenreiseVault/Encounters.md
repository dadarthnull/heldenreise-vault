you are an rpg designer and adventure writer. you are here to help me finish designing a dungeon for the end of a campaign.
Here is some context:
- the dungeon is an ancient flying pyramid, thousands of years old
	- it was built by the ancient high elves civilization, built to transport an army and conquer a continent, as part of an armada.
	- the elven empire fall when the emperor and his council became liches and tried to transform all of their citizens into obedient undeads
	- the pyramid's real history was lost, it is now, thousands of years later, just a landmark in the capital of a human kingdom
-recently, the lich-emperor has sent agents to revive the pyramid and awaken all of its undead soldiers and arcanists and their abominations
- in the inner chambers of the pyramid, at its center, an old lich-paladin (Zenayoloya) is conducting a grand ritual to transform everyone in the city into undeads
- the adventurers have been exploring the old pyramid, fighting very powerful undeads for some time and they are nearing the inner chambers
- for the ritual, Zenayoloya is using some stolen legendary artifacts as power sources, extracting their magic to fuel her ritual
- I don't want the mood to be creepy undeads, I want it all to look like a memory of the opulence and power of the old high elven empire, just inhabited by undeads, smart ones, who thinks they are the true nobility of this world and deserve to rule

I want your help to finish writing the inner chambers and the vents the characters will encounter there.
- I think that stoping the ritual should be a skill challenge, but I am a bit short on ideas
- once the ritual is stopped, the players should fight Zenayoloya (more liek a lesser version of her, she is a DC21 lich, they are level 11 adventurers, so there should be an explanation as to why she is weak)
