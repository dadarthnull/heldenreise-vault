**Description:** Once young warriors training for knighthood, these wretched undead retain echoes of their servile devotion. Clad in tattered tabards and dented half-plate, they scurry between their masters, fetching weapons, blocking blows, and hurling themselves before strikes meant for their lords. Their hollow eyes still seek approval they will never receive.

**Difficulty:** 14      
**Speed**: 20ft
**HP:** 90  
**DPR:** 18  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 9 per attack

**Base - Dutiful Strike:** Melee weapon attack, **+5** to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **9 [1d8+4]** slashing damage.

**Signature - For My Master! (1/short rest):** The Squire designates a Death Knight within 15ft. The Squire can move up to its speed toward the Death Knight and does not trigger attacks of opportunities. The Squire's next attack against a creature that damaged its master deals an additional **15 [3d6]** damage.

**Reaction - Intercept:** When a Death Knight within 10ft is targeted by an attack or spell, the Squire can move up to 10ft to become the target instead, taking the damage or effect in the Death Knight's place.

**Feat - Squire's Fervor:** While within 30ft of a Death Knight, the Squire is immune to the frightened condition and has **advantage on saving throw**s against being charmed or turned. When a Death Knight within 30ft is reduced to 0 HP, the Squire gains **20 temporary HP** and **advantage on all attacks** for 1 minute (fury at their master's fall).

**Feat - Flanking Maneuver:** (Passive) The Squire has **advantage** on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the Squire’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
