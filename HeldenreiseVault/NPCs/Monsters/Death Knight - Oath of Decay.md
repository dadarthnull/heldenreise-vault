**Description:** This knight's armor is corroded and bubbling, fused to rotting flesh beneath. Clouds of spores and toxic vapor seep from gaps in the plate, and every step leaves behind a trail of diseased slime. Flies swarm eternally around its helm, and its voice gurgles with the sound of liquefying organs. It spreads plague as worship.
