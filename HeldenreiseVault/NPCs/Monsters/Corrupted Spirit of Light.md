**Description:** These were once beings of pure radiance—guardian spirits summoned by high elven priests to protect sacred spaces. When the Emperor's corruption spread through the temples, these spirits were twisted but not destroyed. They now appear as humanoid figures of brilliant gold and white light, but their luminescence is cold and their halos are cracked. They weep tears of light that burn like acid, and their touch brings not comfort but the cold of the grave. They cannot remember what they once protected, only that they must protect still.

**Difficulty:** 11  
**HP:** 140  
**DPR:** 30  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 15 per attack

**Base - Weeping Light:** Ranged spell attack, range 60ft, one target. Deals 2d8+4 radiant damage. If the target is a living creature that has damaged an undead this turn, they have disadvantage on their next attack roll (the spirit's sorrow disrupts aggression against the dead).

**Signature - Corona of Grief (Recharge 5-6):** The Spirit unleashes its broken radiance in a 30ft radius burst centered on itself. Living creatures must make a Constitution save. On a failure, they take 5d8 radiant damage and are wracked with despair (disadvantage on all attacks and ability checks for 1 round). On a success, half damage and no despair. Undead in the area are healed for 3d8 HP.

**Reaction - Flicker:** When targeted by an attack, the Spirit can become momentarily incorporeal, gaining resistance to all damage from that attack. If the attack still deals damage, the Spirit can teleport up to 15ft.

**Feat - Luminous Corruption:** The Spirit retains echoes of its divine purpose, usable once each per combat:

- _Guiding Grief:_ As a bonus action, the Spirit illuminates a target within 60ft with a halo of corrupt light for 1 minute. Attacks against that target by undead have advantage, and the target emits bright light in a 10ft radius (they cannot benefit from invisibility or hiding).
    
- _Blinding Tears:_ As an action, the Spirit weeps a torrent of burning light at a creature within 30ft. That creature must make a Dexterity save or take 3d10 radiant damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn.
    
- _False Sanctuary:_ As a reaction when an ally within 30ft takes damage, the Spirit wraps them in light. That ally gains 2d10 temporary HP, but if they are living, they also take 1d10 radiant damage (the sanctuary rejects the living).
    
- _Illuminate the Fallen:_ As an action, the Spirit touches an undead ally. That ally gains 30 temporary HP and its attacks deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage for 1 minute.
