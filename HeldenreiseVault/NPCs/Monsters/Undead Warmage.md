**Description:** The empire's battle mages were weapons of conquest—elves who channeled raw elemental destruction and bolstered armies with arcane might. In undeath, their power remains undiminished, flames and frost crackling around their skeletal forms. They wear scorched and frost-rimed war robes reinforced with enchanted mail, and their skull-faces are etched with elemental runes that glow when they cast. They approach combat with tactical precision, alternating between devastating attacks and empowering their allies.

**Difficulty:** 13  
**Speed:** 30ft
**HP:** 190  
**DPR:** 42  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 21 per attack

**Base - Elemental Strike:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals 2d8+6 damage of a chosen type (fire, cold, or lightning). The Warmage can change the type with each attack. On a hit, the target suffers an additional effect based on damage type:

- _Fire:_ Burns for 1d6 fire damage at the start of their next turn.
- _Cold:_ Speed reduced by 10ft until end of their next turn.
- _Lightning:_ Cannot take reactions until end of their next turn.

**Signature - Elemental Cataclysm (Recharge 5-6):** The Warmage unleashes a devastating combination of elements. Choose two different 20ft radius areas within 90ft (they may overlap):

- One area erupts in flame: 4d8 fire damage, Dexterity save for half, area burns for 1 minute (2d6 fire damage to creatures entering or starting turn there).
- One area freezes: 4d8 cold damage, Constitution save for half, area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.
- One area storms: 4d8 lightning damage, Dexterity save for half, creatures in metal armor have disadvantage on the save.

Creatures in overlapping areas suffer both effects.

**Reaction - Arcane Redirection:** When the Warmage is targeted by a spell that deals elemental damage (fire, cold, lightning, thunder, or acid), it can attempt to absorb and redirect it. The Warmage makes an Intelligence check against DC 10 + the spell's level. On success, the Warmage takes no damage and its next Elemental Strike deals an additional 2d8 damage of the absorbed type.

**Feat - Arsenal of Destruction:** The Warmage commands elemental warfare, usable once each per combat:

- _Meteor Strike:_ As an action, a blazing rock falls on a point within 120ft. Creatures within 15ft must make a Dexterity save or take 6d6 fire damage plus 3d6 bludgeoning damage. Half damage on success. The impact creates a 10ft radius crater of difficult terrain.
    
- _Cone of Cold:_ As an action, the Warmage breathes a 60ft cone of freezing air. Creatures in the area take 6d8 cold damage and have their speed halved for 1 minute (Constitution save for half damage and no speed reduction).
    
- _Chain Lightning:_ As an action, lightning arcs from the Warmage to a target within 90ft, dealing 5d8 lightning damage. It then jumps to up to three additional targets within 30ft of the previous target, dealing 3d8 lightning damage to each. Each target can make a Dexterity save for half damage.
    
- _Mass Shield:_ As a bonus action, the Warmage projects arcane barriers onto up to four allies within 60ft. Each gains 2d8+5 temporary HP and resistance to elemental damage (fire, cold, lightning) until the start of the Warmage's next turn.
    
- _Elemental Infusion:_ As a bonus action, the Warmage touches an ally's weapon or an undead ally's natural attacks. For 1 minute, that weapon deals an additional 2d6 damage of a chosen elemental type (fire, cold, or lightning) on each hit.
