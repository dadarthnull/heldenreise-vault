# Garmr, the Stitched Howler

## Description

> *It was once a hound—perhaps many hounds. Now it is a mountain of rotting flesh and exposed bone, stitched together with blackened sinew and rusted chains. Six legs of mismatched size propel its bulk forward in a lurching gallop, while three heads—wolf, mastiff, and something eyeless and serpentine—snap and howl in discordant chorus. Pustulent sacs bulge along its flanks, filled with churning green ichor. Where it treads, the ground blackens. Where it breathes, the living choke. It does not hunt for food. It hunts because it remembers, somewhere in its patchwork brain, that hunting is what hounds do.*

## Multi-Headed

Garmr has three heads, each with its own personality and attack style. It cannot be surprised and has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

| Wolf Head | 60 | Savage Bite, Pack Instinct |

---

## Legendary Actions (3 per round)

Garmr can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Garmr regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

---

### Lurch (1 Action)

Garmr moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

---

### Snap (1 Action)

One of Garmr's heads makes a bite attack (Wolf or Serpent head only).

---

Garmr ruptures one of the ichor sacs along its body. All creatures within **15ft** must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw**.

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|

---

### Terrifying Presence (2 Actions)

Each creature of Garmr's choice within **60ft** that can see or hear it must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Garmr's Terrifying Presence for 24 hours.

---

## Passive Abilities

### Undead Fortitude

If damage reduces Garmr to 0 HP, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, Garmr drops to 1 HP instead.

---

### Stitched Regeneration

At the start of each of Garmr's turns, it regains **15 HP** if it has at least 1 HP. If Garmr takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of Garmr's next turn.

---

### Six-Legged Stability

Garmr has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone. If Garmr is knocked prone, it can stand up by spending only 10ft of movement.

---

### Carrion Stench

Any creature that starts its turn within **10ft** of Garmr must succeed on a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to Carrion Stench for 24 hours.

---

### Death Burst

When Garmr dies, it explodes in a shower of necrotic viscera. Each creature within **20ft** must make a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **28 [8d6]** necrotic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour.

Additionally, **2d4 Corpse Hounds** rise from the remains at the start of the next round.

---

## Lair Actions

---

### Grasping Chains

Chains burst from the walls and floor, targeting up to **3 creatures** Garmr can see within 60ft. Each target must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** or be restrained until initiative count 20 of the next round. A restrained creature can use its action to make a **DC 15 Strength check**, freeing itself on a success.

---

### Corpse Eruption

The ground in a **15ft radius** centered on a point Garmr can see within 60ft churns with buried remains. Each creature in the area must make a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** or take **14 [4d6]** bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. **1d4 Corpse Hounds** rise in the area.

---

### Necrotic Fog

A 20ft radius sphere of dark mist fills an area within 90ft. The area is heavily obscured. Living creatures that start their turn in the mist or enter it for the first time on a turn take **10 [3d6]** necrotic damage. The mist lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round.

---

## Tactics

> [!tip] Combat Behavior
> 
> **Opening:** Garmr opens with Thunderous Howl to deafen and summon reinforcements, then charges the most heavily armored target.

> - The Wolf head savages prone targets
> - The Serpent head poisons anyone trying to kite from range
> 
> **Legendary Actions:**
> - Uses Lurch to close gaps or escape dangerous positions
> - Uses Pustule Burst when surrounded
> - Uses Snap to pressure backline characters
> 
> **Desperation (below 100 HP):**
> - Becomes reckless, using all attacks on a single target
> - Burns remaining pustules rapidly
> - Tries to grapple multiple creatures to bring them into Death Burst range

## Narrative Hooks

### Origins

- Created by a necromancer from the corpses of war hounds, hunting dogs, and one beloved pet that died of old age (the eyeless serpent head—the necromancer's attempt to give it "new sight")
- The three heads retain fragments of memory: the wolf remembers the hunt, the mastiff remembers guarding its master, the serpent remembers... nothing, only hunger
- Garmr escaped its creator and now roams, driven by instinct to hunt, kill, and collect more bodies to add to itself

### Encounter Contexts

- **Guardian:** Garmr guards the entrance to a necromancer's lair, its three heads watching three separate corridors
- **Pursuit:** The party flees through a ruined city as Garmr hunts them, its howls summoning corpse hounds from every graveyard they pass
- **Gladiatorial:** The party is thrown into a pit with Garmr as entertainment for a vampire lord
- **Corrupted Pet:** A grieving noble paid a necromancer to resurrect their beloved hound—this is what came back

## Loot

### Garmr's Collar

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This rusted iron collar still pulses with necrotic energy. While wearing it:

- You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell
- You can cast *speak with dead* once per long rest, but only on beast corpses
- Once per short rest, you can let out a terrifying howl. Each creature of your choice within 30ft must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute

**Curse:** While attuned, you have an overwhelming urge to chase fleeing creatures. When a creature you can see moves away from you, you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward it.

---

### Vial of Stitching Ichor

*Potion, uncommon*

This viscous green fluid sloshes unpleasantly. When poured over a corpse of a beast (CR 2 or lower) that died within the last hour, the beast rises as a zombie under your control for 8 hours. The zombie uses the beast's stat block but gains immunity to poison and necrotic damage, and its type becomes undead.

You can also drink the ichor (if you dare). If you do, you regain **4d8** HP, but you must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

---

### Serpent Head Fang

*Weapon (dagger), rare*

This curved fang drips with eternal venom. You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. On a hit, the target takes an additional **1d6** poison damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.
