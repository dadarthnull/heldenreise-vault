**Description:** Young mages who died during their studies, these undead retain their desperate hunger for knowledge but lack the power of their masters. They appear as skeletal elves in tattered apprentice robes of deep blue, their eye sockets filled with flickering motes of arcane light. Their spellbooks are fused to their ribcages, pages fluttering despite no wind. They cast spells through rote memory, their magic functional but unrefined, and they are fiercely territorial about their study areas.

**Difficulty:** 9  
**Speed:** 30ft
**HP:** 80  
**DPR:** 18  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 9 per attack

## Build 1
**Base - Arcane Bolt:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals 1d10+4 force damage. Alternatively, the Student can cast a minor ward on an ally within 30ft, granting them +2 AC until the start of the Student's next turn.

**Signature - Unfinished Thesis (1/combat):** The Student desperately channels a spell beyond their ability. Choose one effect:

- _Overcharged Bolt:_ One target within 90ft takes 4d10 force damage (Dexterity save for half).
- _Unstable Shield:_ All allies within 20ft gain 2d8 temporary HP and resistance to one damage type of the Student's choice until the end of the Student's next turn.

After using this ability, the Student takes 2d6 force damage from the strain.

**Reaction - Counterspell Attempt:** When a creature within 30ft casts a spell of 2nd level or lower, the Student can attempt to counter it. The caster must make a spellcasting ability check against DC 9 or the spell fails.

**Feat - Incomplete Education:** The Student knows fragments of greater magic, usable once each per combat:

- _Magic Missile Volley:_ The Student fires three missiles, each dealing 1d4+1 force damage. These can target the same creature or different creatures within 120ft.
    
- _Arcane Step:_ As a bonus action, the Student teleports up to 20ft to an unoccupied space it can see.
    
- _Study Group:_ When within 30ft of another Arcane Student, both Students can use their reaction to combine their Arcane Bolts into a single attack that deals 2d10+8 force damage and pushes the target 10ft on a hit.

## Build 2
**Base:** **Practice Bolt.** Ranged spell-strike (90 ft). On hit, deal **16** force damage. The student may instead “assist” an ally within 60 ft: that ally gains +2 to its next attack roll before the end of its next turn (no attack roll).

**Signature:** **Unstable Thesis.** Choose a point within 90 ft; creatures in a 15-ft radius make a DC 16 Dex save. On a failure, take **28** force damage and be pushed 10 ft; on a success, half damage and no push.

**Reaction:** **Crammed Ward.** When the student is hit, it gains a **20**-HP barrier until the start of its next turn (excess damage carries over).

**Feat:** **Flash of Insight.** Once per turn, when a creature within 60 ft fails a save against an arcane effect, the student deals **6** psychic damage to it (representing intrusive rune-echoes).

## Build 3

- **Base:** _Force Bolt._ Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 4d10+5 force damage.
- **Signature:** _Poly-bomb._ The Student attempts to transmute a target into a harmless critter, but fails catastrophically. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom save. On a specific failure, they are _Stunned_ and take 6d6 force damage as their form wavers. On a success, they are merely slowed.
- **Reaction:** _Group Assignment._ When an ally within 30 feet casts a spell, the Student can use its reaction to increase the DC of that spell by 2 or give the attack roll Advantage.
- **Feat:** _Wild Volley._ Once per turn, when the Student misses with an attack, the stray bolt ricochets to a different random creature within 30 feet (Enemy or Ally) using the same attack roll.
