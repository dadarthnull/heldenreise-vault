## Death Mount

**Description:** The lowest rung of the temple hierarchy—common elves who served the priesthood in life and continue their menial duties in death. These shambling corpses wear rotted servant robes embroidered with faded golden thread, still clutching brooms, incense burners, or ceremonial items. Their movements are jerky but purposeful, and they react with sudden violence when temple grounds are desecrated by the living.

**Difficulty:** 11   
**Speed**: 20ft
**HP:** 150  
**DPR:** 18  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 9 per attack

**Base - Clumsy Swipe:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **9 [1d8+4]** bludgeoning damage.  If both attacks in a round hit the same target, that target’s speed is reduced by 10 ft until the end of its next turn.

**Base - Nauseous Bite:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target, requires the target to be grappled. Deals **9 [1d8+4]** necrotic damage.  The target must succeed on a *Constitution* saving throw or be Poisoned until the start of its next turn.

**Signature - Undying Service (1/combat):** When the Zombie Servant is reduced to 0 HP, it can immediately move up to its speed and make one attack before falling. If this attack hits, the Zombie Servant remains at 1 HP instead of falling.

**Reaction - Grabbing Hands:** When a creature within 5ft attempts to move away, the Zombie Servant grabs at them. The creature must succeed on a Strength save or have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their turn.

**Feat - Herd Mentality:** The Zombie Servant has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one other Zombie Servant is within 5ft of that creature and isn't incapacitated. Additionally, when a Zombie Servant within 30ft is destroyed, this Zombie Servant can immediately move up to 15ft toward the attacker.
