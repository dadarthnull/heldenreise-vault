**Description:** Towering constructs of enchanted stone and crystallized mana, these guardians once protected the empire's most precious knowledge. Standing twelve feet tall, their bodies are covered in glowing arcane circuitry that pulses with barely contained power. Their faces are featureless save for a single burning eye that tracks all movement. When the empire fell to corruption, these golems did not change—they simply continued following their last orders, now defending libraries of forbidden knowledge and undead masters. They are methodical, relentless, and utterly without mercy.

**DPR:** 44

**Dmg:** 22 per attack

## Build 1
**Base - Crushing Fist:** Melee weapon attack, reach 10ft, one target. Deals 3d8+8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 force damage. On a hit, the target must make a Strength save or be pushed 10ft and knocked prone.

**Signature - Mana Overload (Recharge 5-6):** The Golem's arcane circuitry flares as it releases stored magical energy. All creatures within 30ft must make a Dexterity save. On failure, they take 6d10 force damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On success, half damage and not stunned. The Golem then cannot use reactions until the start of its next turn (systems recharging).

**Reaction - Arcane Absorption:** When the Golem is targeted by a spell, it can attempt to absorb the magical energy. The Golem gains temporary HP equal to 5 times the spell's level (minimum 5 for cantrips). If this brings its temporary HP above 30, it automatically recharges Mana Overload.

**Feat - Construct Protocols:** The Golem operates on ancient magical programming:

- _Damage Immunities:_ The Golem is immune to poison and psychic damage, and to the charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions.
    
- _Siege Monster:_ The Golem deals double damage to objects and structures.
    
- _Arcane Targeting:_ At the start of each turn, the Golem identifies the creature within 60ft that has cast the most spells this combat. That creature is designated as Priority Target; the Golem has advantage on attacks against them and they have disadvantage on saving throws against the Golem's abilities.
    
- _Emergency Protocol (1/combat):_ When reduced to half HP or below, the Golem can activate emergency repairs. It regains 4d10 HP and gains resistance to all damage until the start of its next turn. Its eye glows red, and it must use its next turn to move toward and attack the nearest creature (prioritizing spellcasters).

## Build 2
**Base:** **Runic Slam.** Melee strike. On hit, deal **26** bludgeoning + force damage.

**Signature:** **Sentinel Beam Sweep.** The golem projects a rotating beam in a 60-ft line, 10 ft wide. Creatures in the line make a DC 21 Dex save. On a failure, take **44** force damage and be knocked prone; on a success, half damage and not prone.

**Reaction:** **Spell Absorption Matrix.** When the golem takes damage from a spell or magical effect, reduce that damage by **20** and the golem gains **20** temporary HP.

**Feat:** **Arcane Lockdown.** Once per turn after the golem hits a creature with a Base attack, that creature must succeed on a DC 21 Str save or be **Restrained** by gravity-sigils until the end of its next turn.

## Build 3

- **Base:** _Arcane Smash._ Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 3d10+7 bludgeoning damage plus 1d10 force damage.
- **Signature:** _Evocation Flare._ The golem vents excess magic. Every creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 10d8 force damage and are knocked Prone.
- **Reaction:** _Spell Reflection._ If a line spell or a spell requiring a ranged attack roll targets the Golem, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the golem is hit. On a 4-6, the golem is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as if it originated from the Golem.
- **Feat:** _Magical Immunity Shell._ (Passive) The Golem has resistance to damage from Spells. It is immune to any spell of 3rd level or lower.
