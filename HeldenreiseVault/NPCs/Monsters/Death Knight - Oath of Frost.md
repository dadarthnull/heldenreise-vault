**Description:** Encased in armor rimed with eternal ice, this knight radiates a cold so profound it snuffs torches and freezes breath mid-air. Its blade is a shard of frozen sorrow, and its voice carries the howl of blizzards. Where it walks, frost spreads across stone, and those who meet its gaze feel their hearts slow.

**Difficulty:** 17       
**Speed**: 30ft
**HP:** 240  
**DPR:** 66  
**Atk:** 3
**Dmg:** 22 per attack

**Base - Frostmourne's Echo:** Melee weapon attack, **+9** to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **17 [2d8+7]** slashing damage plus **5 [1d8]** cold damage. The target’s speed is reduced by 10 ft until the start of the knight’s next turn (stacks to a minimum of 0).

**Condition - Frosted**: An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the attack action.

**Condition - Frozen**: An affected target is *restrained* and *vulnerable to bludgeoning* damage; strength save at end of turn to break free.
