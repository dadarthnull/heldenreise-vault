**Description:** High-ranking clergy who fully embraced the Emperor's transformation, these undead retain their magical power and zealous devotion. They wear elaborate vestments of white silk interwoven with golden filigree depicting the Emperor's ascension to lichdom—now they see it as apotheosis rather than damnation. Their magic is light corrupted at its source, radiance that heals the dead and harms the living, blessings that become curses. They preach with fervent conviction that undeath is salvation.

**Difficulty:** 15
**Speed**: 30ft
**HP:** 200  
**DPR:** 40  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 20 per attack

**Base - Inverted Radiance:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals 2d10+5 radiant damage to living creatures. Alternatively, heals an undead ally for 2d10+5 HP. The Priest can split this between two targets within range (one attack roll or healing effect each).

**Signature - The Emperor's Judgment (Recharge 5-6):** The Priest raises a holy symbol of the Eternal Emperor, unleashing a wave of corrupt divinity in a 40ft cone. Living creatures take 6d8 radiant damage and must make a Wisdom save or be blinded until the end of their next turn. Undead creatures in the area instead heal for 4d8 HP and gain advantage on attacks for 1 round.

**Reaction - Martyrdom Protocol:** When an undead ally within 30ft would be destroyed, the Priest can sacrifice 3d10 of its own HP to keep that ally at 1 HP instead. The rescued undead gains resistance to all damage until the end of its next turn.

**Feat - Divine Arsenal:** The Priest retains mastery of temple magic, usable once each per combat:

- _Mass Corruption:_ As an action, the Priest targets up to three creatures within 60ft. Each must make a Constitution save or take 3d8 necrotic damage and have their healing received halved for 1 minute (save at end of each turn).
    
- _Sanctuary of Bone:_ As a bonus action, the Priest creates a shimmering barrier around itself. Until the start of its next turn, it has resistance to all damage, but cannot move.
    
- _Word of the Emperor:_ As an action, the Priest speaks a word of absolute command. One creature within 30ft must make a Wisdom save or be compelled to kneel (prone and incapacitated) until the end of its next turn. Undead are immune.
    
- _Blessed Ammunition:_ As a bonus action, the Priest touches up to three undead allies within 30ft. Their next attacks deal an additional 2d6 radiant damage.
    
- _Revoke Life:_ As an action, the Priest targets a creature within 60ft that is at half HP or below. That creature must make a Constitution save or take 4d10 necrotic damage as the Priest attempts to tear the life force from their body. On a successful save, half damage.
