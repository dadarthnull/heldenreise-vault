**Description:** These serpentine entities were once pure magical constructs used to channel and store arcane energy throughout the empire's great libraries. When the corruption spread, they became predatory, their translucent eel-like forms now crackling with unstable violet and blue lightning. They swim through the air in sinuous patterns, their lamprey-like mouths lined with crystalline teeth that drain magical essence. They are drawn irresistibly to spellcasting, attacking casters with frenzied hunger and growing stronger with each spell they consume.

**Difficulty:** 11  
**Speed**: 60ft
**HP:** 120  
**DPR:** 28  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 14 per attack

**Base - Arcane Bite:** Melee weapon attack, reach 10ft, one target. Deals 2d8+4 force damage. If the target is concentrating on a spell, they have disadvantage on the concentration check caused by this damage.

**Signature - Mana Drain (Recharge 5-6):** The Spirit latches onto a creature within 5ft and siphons magical energy. The target must make an Intelligence save. On a failure, they take 4d10 force damage, lose their lowest remaining spell slot (if any), and cannot cast spells of 3rd level or higher until the end of their next turn. On a success, half damage and no other effects. If a spell slot is consumed, the Arcane Spirit gains 2d10 temporary HP and advantage on all attacks until the end of its next turn.

**Reaction - Spell Scent:** When a creature within 60ft casts a spell of 1st level or higher, the Arcane Spirit can immediately move up to half its fly speed toward that creature. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

**Feat - Magic Glutton:** The Arcane Spirit is attuned to magical energies:

- _Spell Resistance:_ The Spirit has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
    
- _Arcane Feedback:_ When the Spirit succeeds on a saving throw against a spell, the caster takes 2d6 force damage as the spell energy rebounds.
    
- _Frenzied by Magic:_ Whenever a spell of 3rd level or higher is cast within 30ft of the Spirit, it can make one Arcane Bite attack as a reaction (this replaces Spell Scent for that trigger).
