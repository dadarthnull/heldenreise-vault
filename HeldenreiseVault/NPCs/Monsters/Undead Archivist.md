**Description:** These were the empire's theoretical mages—scholars who studied magic itself rather than its applications. In undeath, their obsession has calcified into mania. They appear as gaunt, robed figures whose flesh has partially sublimated into pure magical energy, making them semi-translucent. Their hands trail ink-like shadows, and floating tomes orbit their bodies like satellites. They view combat as an interruption to their eternal research but dispatch intruders with cold, precise applications of arcane law.

**Base - Arcane Thesis:** Ranged spell attack, range 120ft, one target. Deals 2d10+5 force damage. On a hit, the Archivist learns the target's lowest saving throw; until the end of the Archivist's next turn, the next spell targeting that creature has advantage on any spell attack roll or the creature has disadvantage on its save.

**Signature - Rewrite Reality (Recharge 5-6):** The Archivist speaks words of fundamental arcane law, altering the battlefield. Choose one:

- _Spatial Collapse:_ A 20ft radius sphere centered on a point within 90ft compresses. All creatures in the area must make a Strength save or take 5d8 force damage and be pulled to the center, ending prone. On a success, half damage and not pulled.
- _Temporal Stutter:_ One creature within 60ft is shunted out of time. They vanish until the end of the Archivist's next turn, reappearing in the same space (or nearest unoccupied space). They are unaware time has passed and lose their next turn.
- _Inversion:_ A 30ft cone reverses magical polarities. Each creature in the area takes 4d8 force damage (Constitution save for half). For 1 minute, healing spells deal damage and damaging spells heal within this area.

**Reaction - Arcane Notation:** When the Archivist observes a spell being cast within 60ft, it can record the spell. The next time the Archivist uses Arcane Thesis, it can replicate the recorded spell's damage type instead of force damage, and add 1d8 damage of that type.

**Feat - Master of the Arcane:** The Archivist's knowledge of magical theory is vast, usable once each per combat:

- _Dispel Matrix:_ As an action, the Archivist creates a 30ft radius antimagic pulse centered on a point within 90ft. All spells of 4th level or lower in the area immediately end. Magical items are suppressed for 1 round. Creatures with active magical effects take 2d8 force damage per effect ended on them.
    
- _Leyline Redirect:_ As a reaction when a spell is cast within 60ft, the Archivist can change the target of that spell to a different valid target within range. The new target must be determined before the original effect resolves.
    
- _Arcane Lock:_ As an action, the Archivist targets a creature within 60ft. That creature must make a Wisdom save or be unable to cast spells until the end of their next turn. If they attempt to cast a spell while locked, they take 3d8 psychic damage.
    
- _Floating Grimoire:_ As a bonus action, the Archivist sends one of its orbiting tomes to a space within 30ft. Until the end of combat, the Archivist can cast spells as if it were in the tome's space. The tome has AC 15 and 30 HP; if destroyed, the Archivist takes 4d6 psychic damage.
    
- _Theorize Weakness:_ As a bonus action, the Archivist analyzes a creature within 60ft. Until the end of combat, the Archivist knows that creature's damage vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities, and attacks against that creature by the Archivist score a critical hit on a 19-20.
