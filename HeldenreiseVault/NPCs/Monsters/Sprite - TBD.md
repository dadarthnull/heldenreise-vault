**Description:** The smallest manifestations of arcane energy, these palm-sized motes of light were once harmless byproducts of magical research—pretty curiosities that drifted through the Arcanorum's halls. The corruption has given them a malevolent edge without granting them true intelligence. They swarm like fireflies, their soft blue-white glow now tinged with sickly purple. Individually they are nuisances; in swarms they can drain life force and disrupt spellcasting through sheer interference.

**Difficulty:** 9 (for a swarm of 8-10 sprites)  
**HP:** 60 (swarm)  
**DPR:** 16  
**Atk:** 1 (swarm attack)  
**Dmg:** 16

**Note:** Sprites function as a swarm. The statistics below represent 8-10 sprites acting as a single creature. Individual sprites are nearly harmless.

## Build 1
**Base - Mana Burn (Swarm):** The swarm engulfs a creature in its space or within 5ft. That creature must make a Dexterity save or take 2d8+4 force damage and have disadvantage on Constitution saves to maintain concentration until the start of the swarm's next turn. On a success, half damage and no disadvantage. Alternatively, the swarm can spread out to harass spellcasting—until the start of its next turn, all creatures within 15ft of the swarm's space must make a concentration check (DC 9) when casting a spell or the spell fails.

**Signature - Arcane Interference (Recharge 5-6):** The swarm disperses into a 30ft radius cloud centered on a point within 60ft. This cloud lasts until the end of the swarm's next turn. While in the cloud:

- Spells of 2nd level or lower require a DC 13 spellcasting ability check or fail.
- All creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence checks and saves.
- The area is lightly obscured by swirling motes of light.

The swarm can reform in any space within the cloud at the end of this effect.

**Reaction - Scatter:** When targeted by an area effect spell or ability, the swarm can disperse. It takes half damage (or no damage if it would take half on a save and succeeds) and can teleport up to 30ft, reforming in the new location.

**Feat - Swarm Traits:** The sprite swarm has unique properties:

- _Amorphous:_ The swarm can move through any gap large enough for a Tiny creature without squeezing.
    
- _Swarm Resilience:_ The swarm is immune to the grappled, prone, restrained, stunned, and paralyzed conditions. It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    
- _Mana Scavengers:_ Whenever a spell of 1st level or higher is cast within 30ft of the swarm, it heals 1d4 HP per level of the spell cast (feeding on ambient magical energy).
    
- _Overwhelming Numbers (1/combat):_ If the swarm starts its turn with more than half its HP remaining and has at least one creature in its space, it can attempt to smother that creature. The creature must make a Strength save or be restrained and blinded until the start of the swarm's next turn. While smothered, the creature takes 3d8 force damage at the start of each of its turns.

# Build 2

**Base:** **Needle-Spark.** Ranged spell-strike (60 ft). On hit, deal **9** force damage.

**Signature:** **Spellglut Burst.** The sprite detonates stored magic in a 10-ft radius centered on itself (it survives). Creatures in the area make a DC 15 Dex save, taking **22** force damage on a failure, or half on a success. Any creature concentrating that fails also has disadvantage on its next concentration check before the end of its next turn.

**Reaction:** **Flicker.** When targeted by an attack, the sprite teleports up to 15 ft to a space it can see, imposing disadvantage on that attack.

**Feat:** **Weave-Peck.** Once per turn when the sprite hits a creature, that creature takes **4** psychic damage if it has any spell-like feature available (unused) this combat.

## Build 3
- **Base:** _Static Zap._ Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 30 ft. Hit: 3d6 lightning damage.
- **Signature:** _Volatile Burst._ Upon reaching 0 HP, the Sprite destabilizes and detonates. All creatures within 10 feet take 4d6 force damage.
- **Reaction:** _Dazzle._ When an enemy attacks an ally of the Sprite within 15 feet, the Sprite flares brightly. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Con save or be _Blinded_ until the end of the turn.
- **Feat:** _Illuminator._ (Passive) The Sprite sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius. Invisible creatures within this light are revealed.
