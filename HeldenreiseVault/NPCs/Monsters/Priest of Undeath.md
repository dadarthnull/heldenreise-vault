**Description:** Where the Priests of the Emperor corrupt existing divine magic, these clergy embraced pure necromancy as the new faith. Draped in robes of deep purple and black with bone iconography, they serve as the temple's summoners and soul-binders. Their expertise lies in raising the dead, commanding spirits, and weaving necrotic energy into devastating attacks. They view death not as an end but as the beginning of true service.

**Difficulty:** 15
**Speed**: 30ft
**HP:** 200  
**DPR:** 40  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 20 per attack

**Base - Soul Siphon:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals 2d8+5 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 HP, the Priest can immediately summon a Shade (see below) in that creature's space. Alternatively, the Priest can command one undead minion within 60ft to immediately move up to half its speed and make one attack.

**Signature - Mass Raise Dead (1/combat):** The Priest channels necromantic power into the floor. 1d4+2 Grave Risen (see below) claw their way up from the ground in unoccupied spaces within 30ft of the Priest. They act immediately after the Priest's turn.

**Reaction - Soul Anchor:** When the Priest takes damage that would reduce it to 0 HP, if it has any undead minions within 30ft, it can destroy one of them to remain at 1 HP instead, absorbing their animating energy.

**Feat - Necromantic Repertoire:** The Priest commands death itself, usable once each per combat:

- _Corpse Explosion:_ As an action, the Priest detonates an undead minion within 60ft. Each creature within 15ft of the detonated undead must make a Dexterity save or take 4d8 necrotic damage plus 2d8 piercing damage (bone shrapnel). Half damage on a success.
    
- _Death's Grasp:_ As an action, spectral hands erupt from the ground in a 20ft radius centered on a point within 90ft. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Creatures in the area when it appears must make a Strength save or be restrained. Restrained creatures can repeat the save at the end of each turn.
    
- _Animate Champion:_ As an action, the Priest targets a Medium or Small corpse within 30ft. A Grave Champion (see below) rises from it, acting on the Priest's initiative.
    
- _Life Drain Field:_ As a bonus action, the Priest creates a 15ft radius aura centered on itself for 1 minute. Living creatures that start their turn in or enter the aura take 2d6 necrotic damage. The Priest heals for half the total damage dealt this way at the start of each of its turns.
    
- _Curse of Undeath:_ As an action, the Priest marks a creature within 60ft. That creature must make a Wisdom save. On a failure, for 1 minute, whenever that creature receives healing, they take necrotic damage equal to half the healing received, and nearby undead heal for the same amount.
