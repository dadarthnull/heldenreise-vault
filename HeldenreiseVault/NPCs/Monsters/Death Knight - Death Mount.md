## Death Mount

**Description:** These nightmarish steeds are skeletal warhorses wreathed in spectral flame, their eye sockets burning with the same unholy light as their riders. Hooves of black iron strike sparks of necrotic energy, and their screaming neighs can freeze blood. They share an unnatural bond with their Death Knight, moving as extensions of a single terrible will.

**Difficulty:** 13   
**Speed**: 60ft
**HP:** 150  
**DPR:** 30  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 15 per attack

**Base - Iron Hooves:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals 2d8+5 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 necrotic damage. If the Mount moved at least 20ft straight toward the target before attacking, the target must make a Strength save or be knocked prone.

**Signature - Phantom Gallop (Recharge 5-6):** The Death Mount surges forward up to 60ft. During this move, it can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Creatures it moves through take 4d10 force damage (DC 16 Dex save for half). If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes force damage.

**Reaction - Spectral Sidestep:** When the Mount or its rider is targeted by a ranged attack or spell, the Mount can teleport up to 15ft, potentially causing the attack to miss if it moves out of range or behind cover.

**Feat - Bonded Steed:** While a Death Knight is mounted, the Mount and rider share a health pool (use the combined HP total) and cannot be forcibly dismounted. The rider can use the Mount's Spectral Sidestep reaction even when targeted individually. When the Mount dies, if it had a rider, that Death Knight can continue fighting on foot but has disadvantage on all attacks for 1 round (disorientation).
