**Description:** A towering armored figure, its plate mail eternally weeping crimson from every joint and rivet. The knight's eyes burn with a hunger that transcends death, and wounds inflicted by its blade refuse to close, bleeding freely to feed its unholy vitality. Once a paladin who broke sacred vows for power, now bound eternally to harvest life force.

**Base - Bloodthirsting Blade:** Melee weapon attack, **+9** to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **17 [2d8+7]** slashing damage plus **5 [1d8]** necrotic damage. The Death Knight heals for the necrotic damage dealt.

## Build 1

**Signature - Crimson Harvest (Recharge 5-6):** The Death Knight channels blood magic in a 20ft cone. All creatures must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On a failure, they take **30 [6d8]** necrotic damage and begin hemorrhaging (taking**5 [1d8]** necrotic damage at the start of each turn, save ends). On a success, half damage and no hemorrhage. The Death Knight heals for half of all damage dealt.

**Reaction - Blood Shield:** When the Death Knight takes damage, it can sacrifice a hemorrhaging creature within 30ft to negate up to **30** damage. That creature takes half the negated damage instead.

**Feat - Sanguine Link:** At the start of its turn, the Death Knight can pull blood from all hemorrhaging creatures within 60ft, dealing **8 [2d6]** necrotic damage to each and healing for the total amount dealt.

## Build 2

**Signature - Blood Boil (Recharge 5-6)** The knight drives its sword into the ground, causing the blood of nearby enemies to boil. Each creature within 20 feet must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On a failure, they take **40 [8d8]** necrotic damage, and the Knight regains hit points equal to half the total damage dealt. On a success, they take half damage, and the Knight heals nothing.

**Reaction - Bloodprice Parry.** When the knight is hit by a melee attack, reduce the damage by **20**. If this reduces the damage to 0, the attacker takes **10** necrotic damage.

**Feat - Mark of Blood** When the Knight hits a creature with its Base attack, that creature is _Marked_ until the end of the Knight's next turn. Attacks against a _Marked_ creature score a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19 or 20.
