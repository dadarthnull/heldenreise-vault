**Description:** Acolytes who died before completing their training, these undead retain fragments of liturgical knowledge and magical aptitude. They wear tattered novice robes of white and gold, now stained with grave-dirt and old blood. Faint wisps of corrupted light still flicker around their skeletal hands as they attempt to complete rituals they no longer understand, their hollow voices chanting prayers to the Eternal Emperor.

**Difficulty:** 13
**Speed**: 30ft
**HP:** 150  
**DPR:** 18  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 9 per attack

**Base - Flickering Radiance:** Ranged spell attack, range 60ft, one target. Deals 1d10+4 radiant damage that has been tainted—it appears golden but leaves necrotic burns. Alternatively, the Initiate can use this to grant an undead ally within 30ft 1d8+4 temporary HP.

**Signature - Echoed Blessing (1/combat):** The Initiate channels a fragment of remembered holy power. All undead allies within 20ft gain 2d8 temporary HP and advantage on their next attack roll. Living creatures in the same area must make a Wisdom save or be frightened until the end of their next turn (the blessing feels profoundly wrong to the living).

**Reaction - Desperate Warding:** When an ally within 30ft takes damage, the Initiate can reduce that damage by 2d6 as it interposes a shield of corrupt light.

**Feat - Liturgical Fragments:** The Initiate retains pieces of its training, usable once each per combat:

- _Hymn of Ending:_ As a bonus action, the Initiate chants discordant verses. One creature within 30ft must make a Wisdom save or have disadvantage on concentration checks and saving throws against necrotic damage until the end of its next turn.
    
- _Lesser Consecration:_ The Initiate touches the ground, creating a 10ft radius zone of corrupt sanctity for 1 minute. Undead in the zone have advantage on saving throws; living creatures entering or starting their turn there take 1d6 necrotic damage.
    
- _Final Rites:_ When an undead ally within 30ft is destroyed, the Initiate can use its reaction to cause that ally to explode in corrupt light. Creatures within 10ft of the destroyed undead take 2d8 radiant damage (Dexterity save for half).
