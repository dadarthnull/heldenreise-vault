**Description:** The most horrific creations of the temple—abominations constructed from the bodies of non-elves captured during the empire's expansion. Humans, dwarves, orcs, and others were deemed unworthy of true undeath, so their bodies were "purified" through sacred torture and reconstruction. Multiple corpses are stitched together into shambling masses of mismatched limbs, with mouths sewn shut and eyes replaced with burning golden orbs. Their flesh bears countless ritual scars forming prayers to the Emperor. They exist in constant agony, which they are compelled to share with the living.

**Difficulty:** 11  
**HP:** 200  
**DPR:** 35  
**Atk:** 3  
**Dmg:** 11-12 per attack

**Base - Grasping Appendages:** Melee weapon attack, reach 10ft, one target. Deals 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage. The Penitent has too many limbs; on a hit, the target is grappled (escape DC 11). The Penitent can grapple up to three creatures simultaneously.

**Signature - Share the Sacrament (Recharge 5-6):** The Penitent channels its eternal suffering into a grappled creature. That creature must make a Constitution save. On a failure, they take 6d10 psychic damage as they experience the combined deaths and tortures of every being stitched into the Penitent. On a success, half damage. Either way, the creature is no longer grappled (thrown aside). If no creature is grappled, the Penitent can instead unleash a 20ft radius scream of agony—all creatures in range take 4d8 psychic damage (Wisdom save for half) and are deafened for 1 round.

**Reaction - Agonized Flailing:** When the Penitent takes damage from a creature within 10ft, it reflexively lashes out. The attacker must make a Dexterity save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

**Feat - Constructed Suffering:** The Penitent's patchwork form grants horrific resilience:

- _Redundant Anatomy:_ The Penitent has immunity to being paralyzed, prone, stunned. In addition, it is immune to critical hits. any critical hit against it is reduced to a normal hit.
    
- _Absorbent Mass:_ Once per round, when the Penitent would take damage from a single source, it can reduce that damage by half as its redundant flesh absorbs the blow.
    
- _Shed Components:_ Once per combat, when grappling at least one creature, the Penitent can detach part of itself. It loses 20 HP, but a Crawling Mass (see below) separates from its body in an unoccupied space within 5ft. The grappled creature remains grappled by the Crawling Mass instead.
    

### Crawling Mass (Separated Component)

- **HP:** 30
- **AC:** 9
- **Speed:** 15ft (cannot be reduced)
- **Attack:** +7 to hit, reach 5ft, 1d8+4 bludgeoning damage, target grappled on hit
- **Special:** If grappling a creature at the start of its turn, deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage automatically
- Acts on the Penitent's initiative
