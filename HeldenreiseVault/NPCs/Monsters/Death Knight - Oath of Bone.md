**Description:** This knight's armor is fused with skeletal remains—ribcages form pauldrons, skulls adorn the helm, and spine segments create a billowing cape of bone. It commands the skeletal framework of the dead with mere gestures, and its voice is the rattling of a thousand graves. It sees the skeleton in every living thing and longs to free it.
