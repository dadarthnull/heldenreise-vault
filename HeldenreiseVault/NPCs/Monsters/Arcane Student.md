**Description:** Young mages who died during their studies, these undead retain their desperate hunger for knowledge but lack the power of their masters. They appear as skeletal elves in tattered apprentice robes of deep blue, their eye sockets filled with flickering motes of arcane light. Their spellbooks are fused to their ribcages, pages fluttering despite no wind. They cast spells through rote memory, their magic functional but unrefined, and they are fiercely territorial about their study areas.

**Difficulty:** 9  
**Speed:** 30ft
**HP:** 80  
**DPR:** 18  
**Atk:** 2  
**Dmg:** 9 per attack

**Base - Arcane Bolt:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals 1d10+4 force damage. Alternatively, the Student can cast a minor ward on an ally within 30ft, granting them +2 AC until the start of the Student's next turn.

**Signature - Unfinished Thesis (1/combat):** The Student desperately channels a spell beyond their ability. Choose one effect:

- _Overcharged Bolt:_ One target within 90ft takes 4d10 force damage (Dexterity save for half).
- _Unstable Shield:_ All allies within 20ft gain 2d8 temporary HP and resistance to one damage type of the Student's choice until the end of the Student's next turn.

After using this ability, the Student takes 2d6 force damage from the strain.

**Reaction - Counterspell Attempt:** When a creature within 30ft casts a spell of 2nd level or lower, the Student can attempt to counter it. The caster must make a spellcasting ability check against DC 9 or the spell fails.

**Feat - Incomplete Education:** The Student knows fragments of greater magic, usable once each per combat:

- _Magic Missile Volley:_ The Student fires three missiles, each dealing 1d4+1 force damage. These can target the same creature or different creatures within 120ft.
    
- _Arcane Step:_ As a bonus action, the Student teleports up to 20ft to an unoccupied space it can see.
    
- _Study Group:_ When within 30ft of another Arcane Student, both Students can use their reaction to combine their Arcane Bolts into a single attack that deals 2d10+8 force damage and pushes the target 10ft on a hit.
