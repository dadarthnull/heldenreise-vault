## Luminary Arcanist

**Description:** Threads of pure light weave between their fingers while equations of impossible geometry float behind their eyes. This mage has mastered two of the most fundamental forces—the raw stuff of magic itself and the primordial light that banishes darkness. Their robes are white silk embroidered with silver runes that glow faintly, and their staff is a crystalline focus that refracts light into impossible spectrums. They speak in measured tones, each word precise, for they understand that language itself is merely another form of pattern to be perfected.

**Type:** Humanoid

**Bonus:** +9
**Speed:** 30ft

**Base - Arcane Manipulation:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals **16 [3d6+5]** force damage. Additionally, choose one:

- *Unravel:* The target has disadvantage on concentration checks until the end of its next turn.
- *Redirect:* The Arcanist can move the target 10ft in any direction.
- *Siphon:* If the target is concentrating on a spell, the Arcanist gains **10** temporary HP.

---

**Base - Searing Light:** Ranged spell attack, range 120ft, one target. Deals **22 [4d8+4]** radiant damage. If the target is undead or fiend, the attack deals an additional **9 [2d8]** radiant damage. The target sheds dim light in a 10ft radius until the end of its next turn, preventing it from benefiting from invisibility or hiding.

---

**Signature - Arcane Unmaking (Recharge 5-6):** The Arcanist targets one creature within 60ft and attempts to unravel the magic sustaining it. The target must make an *Intelligence* saving throw. On failure:

- The target takes **28 [8d6]** force damage.
- All spell effects on the target end (both beneficial and harmful).
- The target cannot cast spells or activate magical abilities until the end of its next turn.
- If the target was concentrating on a spell, that spell ends and the target takes an additional **14 [4d6]** psychic damage.

On success, the target takes half damage and spell effects are not ended.

---

**Signature - Radiant Cascade (Recharge 5-6):** The Arcanist calls down pillars of burning light. Three pillars strike points of the Arcanist's choice within 90ft (each a 10ft radius). Creatures in the area must make a *Dexterity* saving throw, taking **24 [6d6+2]** radiant damage on failure, or half on success. A creature in multiple pillar areas is only affected once but makes the save with disadvantage. Additionally, all allies within 30ft of any pillar gain the following benefits until the end of their next turn:

- **+2** bonus to attack rolls.
- Advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
- Their weapon attacks deal an additional **5 [1d8]** radiant damage.

---

**Reaction - Arcane Confluence:** When an ally within 60ft casts a spell, the Arcanist can empower it. Choose one:

- *Amplify:* The spell deals an additional **12 [3d6]** force damage, or heals an additional **12 [3d6]** HP.
- *Extend:* The spell's range is doubled. If the spell has a duration, it is doubled (maximum 1 hour).
- *Quicken:* The ally can immediately move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

---

**Reaction - Blinding Rebuke:** When the Arcanist or an ally within 30ft is hit by an attack, the Arcanist releases a flash of searing light. The attacker must make a *Constitution* saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Whether the save succeeds or fails, the attacker takes **10 [3d6]** radiant damage.

---

**Feat - Weave Sight:** The Arcanist can see magical auras and invisible creatures within 60ft. Additionally, when the Arcanist sees a spell being cast within 60ft, they can identify the spell without requiring a check.

**Feat - Counterspell Mastery:** When a creature within 60ft casts a spell, the Arcanist can use their Reaction to attempt to counter it. The spell fails if it is 5th level or lower. For spells of 6th level or higher, the Arcanist makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + spell level); on success, the spell fails. This uses the Arcanist's Reaction for the round.

**Feat - Light's Blessing (Bonus Action):** The Arcanist touches an ally within 30ft, wrapping them in protective light. Until the end of that ally's next turn, the ally gains **+2 AC**, has advantage on the next saving throw they make, and the next attack they make deals an additional **9 [2d8]** radiant damage.

**Feat - Arcane Echo:** When the Arcanist uses their Arcane Manipulation base attack, they can create an echo of the spell. At the start of their next turn, the echo automatically strikes the same target (no attack roll required) for **10 [2d6+3]** force damage.
