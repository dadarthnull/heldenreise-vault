## Mistress of the Withered Veil

**Description:** Shadows cling to her like loyal servants, pooling at her feet and curling around her fingers even in brightest daylight. Her skin is deathly pale, her eyes twin voids that reflect nothing, and her voice carries whispers that seem to come from just behind your ear. She wears tattered black robes that drift as if submerged in water, and her hair floats in an unfelt breeze. When she smiles, it never reaches those empty eyes. She does not kill quickly—she savors the fear, the despair, the slow unraveling of hope before the final darkness claims her victims.

**Base - Withering Grasp:** Ranged spell attack, range 90ft, one target. Deals **16 [3d8+4]** necrotic damage plus **9 [2d8]** psychic damage. The Sorceress regains HP equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.

- *Creeping Dread:* On hit, the target must make a *Wisdom* saving throw or be frightened of the Sorceress until the end of its next turn.
- *Soul Drain:* If the target is already frightened, they take an additional **7 [2d6]** psychic damage and cannot regain HP until the start of the Sorceress's next turn.

---

**Base - Nightmare Tendrils:** Ranged spell attack, range 60ft, up to three targets within 20ft of each other. Each target takes **14 [3d6+4]** necrotic damage, and shadowy tendrils cling to them. Until the end of the Sorceress's next turn, affected targets have their speed reduced by 15ft and have disadvantage on the first attack roll they make each turn.

**Signature - Veil of Despair (Recharge 5-6):** The Sorceress opens a rift to the plane of shadows. A 40ft radius sphere of creeping darkness appears centered on a point within 90ft. The area is heavily obscured to all creatures except the Sorceress. When the ability activates and at the start of each of the Sorceress's turns for 1 minute:

- All creatures in the area except the Sorceress must make a *Wisdom* saving throw.
- On failure, they take **28 [8d6]** psychic damage, are frightened of the Sorceress, and their worst fears manifest—they have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks while in the area.
- On success, half damage and not frightened.
- Creatures that start their turn in the area and are already frightened automatically fail the save.

The Sorceress regains **10** HP at the start of each of her turns while the Veil persists.

**Reaction - Shadowborne:** Usable once per round. The Sorceress chooses one:

- *Fade to Dark:* When targeted by an attack or spell, the Sorceress can teleport up to 30ft to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving behind a shadowy duplicate. The attack targets the duplicate instead, which vanishes after being struck or at the end of the Sorceress's next turn.
- *Terror's Echo:* When a creature within 60ft succeeds on a saving throw against being frightened, the Sorceress can force them to reroll and take the lower result. If they fail, they take **10 [3d6]** psychic damage.
- *Soul Siphon:* When a creature within 60ft takes necrotic or psychic damage from any source, the Sorceress can regain **15** HP.

---

**Feat - Dread Aura:** All creatures within 15ft of the Sorceress that are not immune to fear have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. Additionally, creatures frightened of the Sorceress take **7 [2d6]** psychic damage at the start of each of their turns.

**Feat - Curse of Weakness (Bonus Action):** The Sorceress curses one creature she can see within 60ft. Until the end of the Sorceress's next turn, the cursed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and any healing they receive is halved. If the cursed creature is already frightened, the curse lasts for 1 minute instead (save ends at end of turn).

**Feat - Life Leech:** Whenever the Sorceress deals necrotic damage, she regains HP equal to one-quarter of the damage dealt (rounded down). Additionally, when a creature within 30ft is reduced to 0 HP, the Sorceress regains **20** HP and can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space within 5ft of where that creature fell.

**Feat - Nightmare Manifestation (Bonus Action):** The Sorceress conjures a Shadow Nightmare in an unoccupied space within 30ft. The Nightmare has 30 HP, AC 14, and acts on the Sorceress's initiative. It can move 40ft (fly, hover) and make one attack: Melee spell attack +8, deals **11 [2d10]** psychic damage and the target must make a *Wisdom* saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. The Nightmare lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed. The Sorceress can have up to two Nightmares active at once.

**Feat - Visions of Death:** Once per short rest, the Sorceress can use an action to force one creature she can see within 60ft to experience a vision of their own death. The target must make a *Wisdom* saving throw. On failure, they take **35 [10d6]** psychic damage, are stunned until the end of their next turn, and are frightened of the Sorceress for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On success, half damage and frightened for one round, not stunned.
