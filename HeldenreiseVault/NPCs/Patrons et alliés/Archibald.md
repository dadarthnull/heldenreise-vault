## Onmyoji of the Sacred Ink

**Description:** Paper talismans flutter around him like autumn leaves caught in a sacred wind, each bearing intricate kanji brushed in cinnabar ink that glows faintly with spiritual power. He wears traditional white and crimson robes, a string of prayer beads clicking softly at his wrist as his brush moves across fresh ofuda with deliberate, meditative strokes. His eyes are calm, patient—he knows that true power requires preparation, that the mightiest seals take time to inscribe. When the final stroke is complete, reality itself bends to the written word.

**Talisman Mechanic:** The Onmyoji can prepare powerful Sealed Talismans that require one turn to inscribe and one turn to activate.

- **Inscribe (Action):** The Onmyoji begins writing a Sealed Talisman. Choose which talisman is being prepared. The talisman is ready at the start of the Onmyoji's next turn.
- **Activate (Action):** The Onmyoji releases a prepared Sealed Talisman. Make an *Intelligence* check (DC 12). On success, the talisman activates at full power. On failure by 4 or less, the talisman activates at half effectiveness. On failure by 5 or more, the talisman fizzles and is wasted.
- The Onmyoji can have only one Sealed Talisman prepared at a time. Preparing a new one destroys the previous.
- If the Onmyoji takes damage while inscribing, they must make a *Constitution* saving throw (DC 10 or half damage taken, whichever is higher) or lose the talisman.

**Base - Instant Ofuda:** Ranged spell attack, range 60ft, one target. Deals **11 [2d6+4]** radiant damage. Quick talismans that require no preparation. Choose one additional effect:

- *Binding Script:* The target must make a *Strength* saving throw or have their speed reduced by 15ft until the end of their next turn.
- *Revealing Light:* Invisible creatures within 10ft of the target become visible, and the target cannot benefit from invisibility until the end of its next turn.
- *Spirit Ward:* If the target is undead, fiend, or aberration, the attack deals an additional **9 [2d8]** radiant damage.

**Sealed Talisman - Seal of Banishment:** (Inscribe one turn, Activate next)

*Activation Check:* Intelligence check DC 12.

- *Full Success:* One creature within 60ft must make a *Charisma* saving throw. On failure, the creature takes **55 [10d10]** force damage and is banished to a harmless demiplane for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the save to return to the space it left (or nearest unoccupied space). Undead, fiends, and aberrations have disadvantage on this save. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 HP, it is permanently destroyed, unable to reform or resurrect for one year.
- *Partial Success:* Half damage, banished for one round only, no disadvantage for special creatures.
- *Failure:* The talisman burns away harmlessly.

**Sealed Talisman - Seal of Binding:** (Inscribe one turn, Activate next)

*Activation Check:* Intelligence check DC 12.

- *Full Success:* One creature within 60ft must make a *Wisdom* saving throw. On failure, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute and takes **20 [4d10]** radiant damage at the start of each of its turns. Sacred chains of light bind it in place. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success but taking the damage regardless. While paralyzed by this effect, the creature cannot teleport, planeshift, or become incorporeal.
- *Partial Success:* Restrained instead of paralyzed, half damage per turn, duration 3 rounds.
- *Failure:* The talisman burns away harmlessly.

**Sealed Talisman - Seal of Purification:** (Inscribe one turn, Activate next)

*Activation Check:* Intelligence check DC 12.

- *Full Success:* A 30ft radius burst of sacred light erupts at a point within 90ft. All creatures of the Onmyoji's choice in the area regain **40** HP, and all curses, diseases, and the following conditions end: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned. Additionally, all enemies in the area must make a *Constitution* saving throw or take **35 [10d6]** radiant damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn. Undead and fiends have disadvantage on this save.
- *Partial Success:* Allies regain 20 HP, one condition ends per ally, enemies take half damage and are not blinded.
- *Failure:* The talisman burns away harmlessly.

**Sealed Talisman - Seal of Calamity:** (Inscribe one turn, Activate next)

*Activation Check:* Intelligence check DC 12.

- *Full Success:* The Onmyoji inscribes a curse of terrible misfortune on one creature within 60ft. The target must make a *Charisma* saving throw. On failure, for 1 minute: all attack rolls against the target have advantage, the target has disadvantage on all saves, any critical hit against the target deals an additional **20 [4d10]** necrotic damage, and the target cannot regain HP. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
- *Partial Success:* Duration 3 rounds, no additional critical damage, can regain HP.
- *Failure:* The talisman burns away harmlessly.

**Signature - Forbidden Scripture (Recharge 6):** The Onmyoji produces an ancient scroll passed down through generations—a talisman so powerful it bypasses the normal preparation requirement. The Onmyoji immediately inscribes and activates one Sealed Talisman of their choice with a single action. The activation check automatically succeeds at full power. Additionally, until the end of the Onmyoji's next turn, all Instant Ofuda attacks deal an additional **14 [4d6]** radiant damage.

---

**Reaction - Warding Script:** Usable once per round. The Onmyoji chooses one:

- *Deflection Talisman:* When the Onmyoji or an ally within 30ft is targeted by an attack, the Onmyoji throws a protective ofuda. The target gains **+5 AC** against that attack. If the attack still hits, the damage is reduced by **15**.
- *Counter Seal:* When a creature within 60ft casts a spell, the Onmyoji can attempt to seal the magic. Make an *Intelligence* check contested by the caster's spellcasting ability check. On success, the spell fails and the caster takes **14 [4d6]** radiant damage.
- *Spirit Anchor:* When a creature within 30ft would teleport, become incorporeal, or planeshift, the Onmyoji can force them to make a *Charisma* saving throw. On failure, the effect fails and the creature takes **10 [3d6]** force damage.

---

**Feat - Sacred Ink:** The Onmyoji's activation checks are made with advantage. Additionally, when the Onmyoji rolls a natural 20 on an activation check, the Sealed Talisman's effects are enhanced: damage is maximized, durations are doubled, and targets have disadvantage on their initial saving throw.

**Feat - Prepared Scriptures:** The Onmyoji begins combat with one Sealed Talisman of their choice already prepared and ready to activate. Additionally, the Onmyoji can maintain two prepared Sealed Talismans simultaneously (though still only one can be inscribed per turn).

**Feat - Flowing Brush (Bonus Action):** The Onmyoji can inscribe a Minor Talisman as a bonus action. Choose one effect:

- *Speed Script:* One ally within 30ft gains 15ft additional speed until the end of their next turn.
- *Shield Script:* One ally within 30ft gains **10** temporary HP.
- *Sight Script:* One ally within 30ft gains truesight out to 30ft until the end of their next turn.
- *Strength Script:* One ally within 30ft deals an additional **7 [2d6]** radiant damage on their next attack.

**Feat - Lingering Wards:** At the end of each of the Onmyoji's turns, if they did not use their Reaction, they can place a stationary Ward Talisman in an unoccupied space within 5ft. The ward lasts for 1 minute and has one of the following effects when a creature enters within 10ft of it:

- *Alarm Ward:* Alerts the Onmyoji telepathically and the triggering creature must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or be outlined in light (as *faerie fire*) for 1 minute.
- *Harm Ward:* The triggering creature must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or take **18 [4d8]** radiant damage.
- *Slow Ward:* The triggering creature must make a *Wisdom* saving throw or have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn.
