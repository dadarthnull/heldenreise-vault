## High Priestess of the Eternal Spring

**Description:** Warmth radiates from her presence like sunlight through morning mist. Clad in flowing white and green vestments embroidered with blooming flowers, she moves with serene purpose through the chaos of battle. Her hands glow with soft golden light, and where she walks, the air smells of spring rain and fresh growth. She carries no weapon—her faith is her shield, her compassion her sword. To her allies, she is hope incarnate. To the dying, she is the gentle hand that pulls them back from the abyss.

**Base - Life's Embrace:** The Priestess channels restorative energy to one ally within 60ft. The target regains **20 [4d6+4]** HP. Additionally, choose one:

- *Mending Touch:* The target can immediately use their Reaction to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- *Fortifying Light:* The target gains **+2 AC** until the start of the Priestess's next turn.
- *Cleansing Waters:* The target can make a new saving throw against one ongoing effect that allows a save at the end of their turn, with advantage.

**Signature - Fountain of Life (Recharge 5-6):** The Priestess raises her hands and calls forth a surge of pure vital energy. A 30ft radius centered on the Priestess fills with shimmering golden light for 1 minute. When the ability activates and at the start of each of the Priestess's turns while the fountain persists:

- All allies within the area regain **15** HP.
- All allies within the area gain **10** temporary HP.
- All allies within the area have advantage on death saving throws.
- One condition of the Priestess's choice ends on each ally (blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned).

Additionally, enemies that enter the area or start their turn there must make a *Wisdom* saving throw or be unable to target allies within the fountain until the end of their turn.

**Reaction - Guardian of the Living:** Usable once per round. The Priestess chooses one:

- *Intervening Grace:* When an ally within 60ft takes damage, the Priestess can reduce that damage by **20** and that ally regains **10** HP.
- *Life's Anchor:* When an ally within 60ft would be reduced to 0 HP, they instead drop to 1 HP and regain **15** HP. This can only affect each ally once per combat.
- *Purifying Light:* When an ally within 60ft fails a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, the Priestess can allow them to reroll the save with advantage.

**Feat - Beacon of Hope (Bonus Action):** The Priestess designates one ally within 60ft as her charge. Until the Priestess uses this ability on a different target or loses concentration, the charge gains the following benefits:

- At the start of each of the charge's turns, they regain **10** HP.
- The charge has advantage on Constitution saving throws and death saving throws.
- When the charge receives healing from any source, they regain an additional **10** HP.

**Feat - Aura of Restoration:** All allies within 15ft of the Priestess regain **5** HP at the start of each of the Priestess's turns. Additionally, allies within this aura have resistance to necrotic damage.

**Feat - Blessed Resilience (Bonus Action):** The Priestess touches one ally within 5ft or herself, granting divine protection. Until the end of that creature's next turn, they have resistance to all damage and are immune to the frightened and charmed conditions.

**Feat - Resurrection Prayer:** If an ally within 30ft has died within the last minute, the Priestess can use her action to begin a resurrection prayer. At the start of her next turn, if she maintained concentration and was not interrupted, the ally returns to life with 1 HP and immediately regains **30** HP. The Priestess cannot use this ability again until she finishes a long rest.

**Feat - Shared Vitality:** When the Priestess heals an ally with her Base ability, she can choose to heal a second ally within 30ft of the first target for half the amount. Additionally, whenever the Priestess heals an ally, she regains **5** HP.
