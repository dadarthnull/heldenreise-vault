**Base - Oathbound Strike:** Melee weapon attack, **+8** to hit, reach 10ft, one target. Deals **16 [2d8+6]** slashing damage.

- *Oath of the Sentinel:* The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than the Knight until the end of its next turn.
- *Oath of the Martyr:* The Knight can choose an ally within 15ft. That ally gains **8** temporary HP.
- *Oath of the Ironclad:* The Knight gains **+2 AC** until the start of its next turn.
- *Oath of the Avenger:* If the target has damaged an ally of the Knight this combat, the attack deals an additional **8 [2d6]** radiant damage.

**Signature - Oath Manifest (Recharge 5-6):** The Knight channels the power of their sacred vow in a burst of divine energy. All creatures within 15ft must make a *Wisdom* saving throw or take **24 [4d10]** radiant damage and suffer an additional effect based on the active Oath. On a success, creatures take half damage and no additional effect.

- *Oath of the Sentinel:* Affected creatures are taunted—they have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone other than the Knight for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).
- *Oath of the Martyr:* All allies within 30ft regain **20** HP and gain resistance to all damage until the start of the Knight's next turn.
- *Oath of the Ironclad:* The Knight gains **40** temporary HP and immunity to the frightened, charmed, and stunned conditions for 1 minute.
- *Oath of the Avenger:* Instead of an area effect, the Knight makes a single devastating strike against one creature within reach. The attack automatically hits and deals **48 [8d10]** radiant damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 HP, the Knight can immediately move up to half its speed and make one Base attack.

---

**Reaction - Oathbound Response:** The Knight reacts according to their active Oath. Usable once per round.

- *Oath of the Sentinel:* **Punishing Strike.** When a creature within 10ft attacks an ally, the Knight can make a Base attack against that creature.
- *Oath of the Martyr:* **Sacrificial Intervention.** When an ally within 15ft takes damage, the Knight can teleport to an adjacent space and take the damage instead. This damage cannot be reduced.
- *Oath of the Ironclad:* **Unyielding.** When the Knight takes damage, reduce that damage by **15**.
- *Oath of the Avenger:* **Retribution.** When the Knight or an ally within 15ft is reduced to half HP or below by an attack, the Knight can move up to half its speed toward the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.

---

**Feat - Oath Sworn:** At the start of combat, the Knight chooses an active Oath. As a bonus action on its turn, the Knight can switch to a different Oath. The Knight can only have one Oath active at a time.

---

### Oath of the Sentinel

*"None shall pass while I draw breath."*

**Feat - Vigilant Guardian:** The Knight has advantage on opportunity attacks. Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from the Knight even if they take the Disengage action. The Knight's reach for opportunity attacks is 15ft.

**Feat - Immovable Object:** The Knight cannot be moved against its will (pushed, pulled, or teleported by enemy effects). The Knight has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone.

---

### Oath of the Martyr

*"My pain is the price of your survival."*

**Feat - Burden of the Faithful:** When an ally within 30ft fails a saving throw, the Knight can choose to have that ally succeed instead. The Knight then suffers the effect that the ally would have suffered, with no saving throw allowed.

**Feat - Wounds of Grace:** When the Knight is at half HP or below, all allies within 30ft have advantage on saving throws and gain +2 to AC.

---

### Oath of the Ironclad

*"I am the shield. I am the wall. I do not break."*

**Feat - Fortress Stance:** While the Knight has not moved since the start of its last turn, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Feat - Unbreakable Will:** The Knight has advantage on all saving throws. When the Knight succeeds on a saving throw against an effect that would deal half damage on a success, it instead takes no damage.

---

### Oath of the Avenger

*"Those who harm the innocent will know my wrath."*

**Feat - Mark of Judgment:** When a creature damages an ally of the Knight, that creature becomes Marked for 1 minute. The Knight has advantage on attack rolls against Marked creatures and deals an additional **5** damage to them. Only one creature can be Marked at a time.

**Feat - Righteous Fury:** When an ally within 30ft is reduced to 0 HP, the Knight immediately gains an extra action on its next turn and has advantage on all attack rolls until the end of that turn.

---

### Conditions

**Condition - Taunted:** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone other than the source of the taunt. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a *Wisdom* saving throw to end the effect.

**Condition - Marked:** The marking creature has advantage on attacks against the marked creature and deals bonus damage. The mark ends if the marking creature marks a different target or is incapacitated.
