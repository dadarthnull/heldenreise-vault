## Windrunner Sharpshooter

**Description:** She never stops moving. A blur of leather and green cloth, bow singing death with every breath. Her arrows fly from impossible angles—behind cover, mid-roll, leaping from rooftops—and each one finds its mark. No armor weighs her down, no hesitation slows her aim. To fight her is to fight the wind itself: everywhere at once, impossible to pin down, and utterly lethal. By the time you've drawn your weapon, three arrows are already in flight.

**Base - Rapid Shot:** Ranged weapon attack, range 150ft, one target. Deals **12 [2d6+5]** piercing damage. The Sharpshooter can move 10ft before or after each attack without provoking opportunity attacks.

- *Pinning Shot (once per turn):* On hit, the Sharpshooter can choose to pin the target. The target must make a *Strength* saving throw or have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn.

---

**Base - Scatter Shot:** Ranged weapon attack, range 60ft, up to three targets within 15ft of each other. Each target takes **10 [2d6+3]** piercing damage. The Sharpshooter makes one attack roll and compares it to each target's AC separately.

- *If all three targets are hit:* The Sharpshooter can immediately move 15ft without provoking opportunity attacks.

---

**Signature - Arrow Storm (Recharge 5-6):** The Sharpshooter unleashes a devastating barrage. Choose one:

- *Focused Barrage:* The Sharpshooter makes eight attacks against a single target. Each hit deals **10 [2d6+3]** piercing damage. If four or more attacks hit, the target must make a *Constitution* saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. If six or more attacks hit, the target automatically fails the save.

- *Sweeping Hail:* The Sharpshooter fires into a 30ft cone. All creatures in the area must make a *Dexterity* saving throw, taking **42 [12d6]** piercing damage on failure, or half on success. Creatures that fail are also knocked prone.

- *Running Volley:* The Sharpshooter moves up to their full speed without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, they can make six attacks against any targets within range, no more than two attacks per target. Each hit deals **12 [2d6+5]** piercing damage.

---

**Reaction - Wind Dancer:** Usable once per round. The Sharpshooter chooses one:

- *Evasive Roll:* When targeted by an attack or spell, the Sharpshooter can move up to 20ft without provoking opportunity attacks. If this moves them out of range or behind full cover, the attack or spell misses.
- *Snap Shot:* When a creature moves within 30ft of the Sharpshooter or moves out of a space within 60ft, the Sharpshooter can make one Rapid Shot attack against that creature.
- *Deflecting Arrow:* When an ally within 60ft is targeted by a ranged attack, the Sharpshooter can fire an arrow to intercept. The ally gains **+5 AC** against that attack. If the attack misses, the Sharpshooter can immediately make one Rapid Shot attack against the attacker.

**Feat - Never Still:** The Sharpshooter can Dash as a bonus action. Additionally, opportunity attacks against the Sharpshooter have disadvantage, and their movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from creatures they have damaged this turn.

**Feat - Eagle Eye:** The Sharpshooter ignores half cover and three-quarters cover. Additionally, their ranged attacks do not have disadvantage at long range, and they can see clearly up to 600ft as if it were bright light.

**Feat - Trick Shots (Bonus Action):** The Sharpshooter prepares a special arrow for their next attack. Choose one:

- *Explosive Arrow:* The next attack that hits deals normal damage, and all creatures within 10ft of the target (except the target) must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or take **14 [4d6]** fire damage.
- *Tethering Arrow:* The next attack that hits anchors the target. The target must make a *Strength* saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.
- *Smoke Arrow:* The next attack creates a 15ft radius of heavy smoke centered on where the arrow lands, lasting until the end of the Sharpshooter's next turn. Creatures in the smoke are heavily obscured.

**Feat - Second Wind:** Once per short rest, the Sharpshooter can use a bonus action to regain **25** HP and immediately move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Feat - Quarry Mark:** As a bonus action, the Sharpshooter marks one creature they can see within 120ft. Against the marked creature, the Sharpshooter's attacks deal an additional **5 [1d10]** piercing damage, and the Sharpshooter always knows the creature's location as long as it is within 300ft. The mark lasts for 1 hour or until the Sharpshooter marks another creature.
