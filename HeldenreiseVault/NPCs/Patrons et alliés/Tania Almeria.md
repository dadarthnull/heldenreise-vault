## Shadowblade Assassin

**Description:** A whisper of movement in the corner of your eye, a cold touch at your throat before you realize anyone was there. This killer has mastered the art of becoming one with darkness, slipping between shadows like water through fingers. Clad in form-fitting black leather that seems to drink the light, their face is hidden behind a featureless mask. They do not fight—they execute. By the time you see them, you're already dead.

**Type:** Humanoid
**Difficulty:** 16
**Bonus:** +10
**Speed:** 40ft
**HP:** 120
**DPR:** 42
**Atk:** 3
**Dmg:** 14 per attack

---

**Base - Shadowfang Blade:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **14 [2d6+6]** piercing damage. If the Assassin has advantage on the attack roll or the target is within 5ft of an ally of the Assassin, the attack deals an additional **10 [3d6]** piercing damage.

---

**Signature - Death From Shadows (Recharge 5-6):** The Assassin teleports through shadows to another shadow point within 60ft, then immediately makes two Base attacks against a creature within reach. Both attacks are made with advantage. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must make a *Constitution* saving throw or take an additional **21 [6d6]** necrotic damage and be paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the additional damage and is not paralyzed.

---

**Reaction - Shadow Slip:** Usable once per round. The Assassin chooses one:

- *Vanishing Step:* When the Assassin takes damage, they can teleport up to 30ft to an unoccupied that contains a shadow (it can be the shadow of another creature or ally). If no valid space exists, this reaction cannot be used.
- *Cloak of Night:* When targeted by an attack, the Assassin imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, the Assassin becomes invisible until the start of their next turn or until they attack.
- *Throat Cutter:* When a creature within 5ft casts a spell with a verbal component, the Assassin can make one Base attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the creature must make a *Constitution* saving throw or lose the spell.

---

**Feat - One With Shadows:** While in dim light or darkness, the Assassin can use a bonus action to become invisible until they attack, cast a spell, or enter bright light. Additionally, the Assassin can see normally in magical and nonmagical darkness out to 120ft.

**Feat - Shadow Step:** As a bonus action, the Assassin can teleport up to 30ft to an unoccupied space they can see that is in dim light or darkness. After teleporting, the Assassin has advantage on the first melee attack they make before the end of their turn.

**Feat - Assassinate:** The Assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. Additionally, any hit the Assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Feat - Evasion:** When the Assassin is subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, they instead take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
