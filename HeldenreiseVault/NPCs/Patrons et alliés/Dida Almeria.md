## Kensei Blademaster

**Description:** A warrior of unparalleled discipline, clad in lacquered armor adorned with the symbols of a fallen lord. Every movement is deliberate, economical, a lifetime of training distilled into lethal efficiency. Their katana is an extension of their soul—never drawn without purpose, never sheathed without blood. In their eyes burns the cold fire of absolute focus, a mind emptied of all but the next cut.

**Type:** Humanoid
**Difficulty:** 16
**Bonus:** +10
**Speed:** 35ft
**HP:** 160
**DPR:** 44
**Atk:** 3
**Dmg:** 15 per attack

---

**Focus Mechanic:** The Blademaster begins combat with 0 Focus. Maximum Focus: 5. Focus is gained through attacks and spent to activate techniques.

---

**Base - Focused Strike:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **15 [2d6+7]** slashing damage. The Blademaster gains **1 Focus**.

- *At 3+ Focus:* The attack deals an additional **7 [2d6]** slashing damage.
- *At 5 Focus:* The attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

---

**Signature - Perfect Cut (Recharge 5-6):** The Blademaster makes a single devastating strike against one creature within 10ft. The attack automatically hits and deals **35 [6d8+7]** slashing damage. The Blademaster gains **2 Focus**. If the Blademaster is at 5 Focus when using this ability, the target must make a *Constitution* saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

---

**Reaction - Way of the Blade:** Usable once per round. The Blademaster chooses one:

- *Steel Meets Steel:* When targeted by a melee attack, the Blademaster can make a contested attack roll. If the Blademaster wins, the attack misses and the Blademaster can immediately make one Base attack against the attacker.
- *Deflecting Cut:* When targeted by a ranged attack, the Blademaster adds **+5** to their AC against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss, the Blademaster gains **1 Focus**.
- *Punishing Counter:* When a creature within 5ft misses the Blademaster with an attack, the Blademaster makes one Base attack against that creature with advantage.

---

**Feat - Iron Resolve (1 Focus):** When the Blademaster takes damage, they can spend 1 Focus to reduce that damage by **20**.

**Feat - Inevitable Cut (2 Focus):** Before making a Base attack, the Blademaster can spend 2 Focus. The attack ignores cover, shield bonuses to AC, and cannot be avoided by reactions such as Shield or Uncanny Dodge.

**Feat - Blade Storm (3 Focus):** As an action, the Blademaster spends 3 Focus and makes a Base attack against every creature within 10ft.

**Feat - Death Before Dishonor (3 Focus):** When the Blademaster would be reduced to 0 HP, they can spend 3 Focus to remain at 1 HP instead. Until the end of their next turn, the Blademaster has advantage on all attacks and their Base attacks deal an additional **10 [3d6]** slashing damage.
