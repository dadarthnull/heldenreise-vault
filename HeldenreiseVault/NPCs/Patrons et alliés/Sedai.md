## Primal Shapechanger

**Description:** Their eyes hold the amber gleam of a wolf, the cold patience of a serpent, the fierce hunger of a hawk—sometimes all at once. This druid has blurred the line between humanoid and beast until it barely exists. Fur ripples across their skin when angered, claws sprout from fingertips mid-gesture, and their voice carries growls beneath the words. They do not merely transform into animals; they have become a living vessel for the primal spirits themselves, calling forth aspects of predator and prey as easily as breathing.

**Aspect Mechanic:** The Primal Shapechanger embodies one bestial Aspect at a time. They begin combat in an Aspect of their choice. Each Aspect modifies their Base attack, grants passive benefits, and changes their Reaction.

---

**Base - Primal Strike:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Effects vary by current Aspect:

- *Wolf Aspect:* Deals **14 [2d8+5]** piercing damage. If an ally is within 5ft of the target, the attack has advantage and deals an additional **5 [2d4]** piercing damage.
- *Bear Aspect:* Deals **18 [2d10+7]** slashing damage. On hit, the target must make a *Strength* saving throw or be knocked prone.
- *Serpent Aspect:* Deals **11 [2d6+4]** piercing damage plus **9 [2d8]** poison damage. On hit, the target must make a *Constitution* saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- *Hawk Aspect:* Deals **13 [2d8+4]** slashing damage. The Shapechanger makes this attack four times instead of three, and can target creatures up to 30ft away by launching razor-sharp feathers.

---

**Signature - Apex Predator (Recharge 5-6):** The Shapechanger fully embraces their current Aspect, becoming a terrifying hybrid form. Effects vary by current Aspect:

- *Wolf Aspect — Pack Takedown:* The Shapechanger and up to three allies within 30ft can immediately move up to half their speed and make one melee attack against a single target. For each attack that hits beyond the first, subsequent attacks deal an additional **7 [2d6]** damage. If all four attacks hit, the target is knocked prone and cannot stand until the end of its next turn.

- *Bear Aspect — Unstoppable Rampage:* The Shapechanger gains **40** temporary HP and grows to Large size. Until the start of their next turn, they have advantage on all attacks, resistance to all damage, and their Base attacks deal an additional **10 [2d10]** bludgeoning damage and push the target 15ft.

- *Serpent Aspect — Venomous Eruption:* The Shapechanger exhales a 30ft cone of toxic miasma. Creatures in the area must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On failure, they take **32 [8d6+4]** poison damage, are poisoned for 1 minute, and take **10 [3d6]** poison damage at the start of each turn while poisoned (save ends at end of turn). On success, half damage and poisoned only until end of next turn.

- *Hawk Aspect — Death From Above:* The Shapechanger gains a fly speed of 60ft until the end of their next turn and makes six Base attacks, each against a different target if possible. For each attack that hits, the target is blinded until the end of its next turn as talons rake across eyes.

---

**Reaction - Bestial Instinct:** Usable once per round. The Shapechanger reacts according to their current Aspect:

- *Wolf Aspect — Coordinated Strike:* When an ally within 30ft hits a creature with an attack, the Shapechanger can move up to half their speed toward that creature and make one Base attack against it.
- *Bear Aspect — Thick Hide:* When the Shapechanger takes damage, they reduce that damage by **15** and cannot be moved against their will until the start of their next turn.
- *Serpent Aspect — Reactive Venom:* When hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes **14 [4d6]** poison damage and must make a *Constitution* saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll.
- *Hawk Aspect — Evasive Flutter:* When targeted by an attack or spell, the Shapechanger can move up to 20ft without provoking opportunity attacks. If this moves them out of range, the attack misses.

---

**Feat - Shift Aspect (Bonus Action):** The Shapechanger can change their current Aspect to a different one. When they do, they immediately gain a benefit based on the new Aspect:

- *Shifting to Wolf:* One ally within 30ft can move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- *Shifting to Bear:* The Shapechanger gains **15** temporary HP.
- *Shifting to Serpent:* The Shapechanger becomes immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition until they shift again.
- *Shifting to Hawk:* The Shapechanger's speed increases by 20ft until end of turn.

**Feat - Hybrid Form:** The Shapechanger can maintain aspects of two forms simultaneously. They choose a primary Aspect (which determines Base attack and Reaction) and a secondary Aspect (which grants its passive benefit). Passive benefits:

- *Wolf:* Advantage on attacks against creatures adjacent to the Shapechanger's allies.
- *Bear:* Maximum HP increases by **20** and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
- *Serpent:* Immunity to poison and attacks deal an additional **5 [1d8]** poison damage.
- *Hawk:* Speed increases by 15ft and opportunity attacks against the Shapechanger have disadvantage.

**Feat - Nature's Resilience:** At the start of each of the Shapechanger's turns, they regain **10** HP if they have at least 1 HP. Additionally, the Shapechanger can use a bonus action to end one of the following conditions on themselves: blinded, charmed, frightened, or poisoned.

**Feat - Alpha Predator:** While the Shapechanger is in any Aspect, beasts of CR 2 or lower within 60ft are frightened of them and will not attack unless cornered. Additionally, once per short rest, the Shapechanger can summon two beasts of CR 2 or lower that appear in unoccupied spaces within 30ft and act on the Shapechanger's initiative.
