## Pitfighter

**Description:** Scarred knuckles, a crooked nose broken too many times to count, and eyes that have seen every dirty trick in the book. This brawler learned to fight not in dojos or training halls, but in back alleys, fighting pits, and tavern brawls where the only rule is survival. They wear their scars like medals, each one a lesson learned the hard way. When fists start flying, they come alive—grinning through blood and broken teeth.

**Type:** Humanoid
**Difficulty:** 15
**Bonus:** +8
**Speed:** 40ft
**HP:** 140

**Grit Mechanic:** The Pitfighter begins combat with 0 Grit. Maximum Grit: 5. Grit is gained through dealing and receiving punishment, and spent to activate dirty tricks and survival instincts.

---

**Base - Brutal Combination:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **10 [1d8+5]** bludgeoning damage. The Pitfighter gains **1 Grit**.

- *At 3+ Grit:* The Pitfighter can make one additional Base attack as part of this action (total 5 attacks).
- *At 5 Grit:* Each attack that hits also deals **3 [1d6]** additional damage as the Pitfighter finds weak points.

---

**Signature - Haymaker (Recharge 5-6):** The Pitfighter winds up and delivers a devastating punch to one creature within 5ft. The target must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On a failure, the target takes **32 [5d10+5]** bludgeoning damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not stunned. Hit or miss, the Pitfighter gains **2 Grit**.

---

**Reaction - Roll With It:** Usable once per round. The Pitfighter chooses one:

- *Take the Hit:* When the Pitfighter takes damage from an attack, they reduce the damage by half and gain **2 Grit**. The Pitfighter must use this before damage is rolled.
- *Slip and Counter:* When a creature misses the Pitfighter with a melee attack, the Pitfighter can immediately make one Base attack against that creature and move 5ft without provoking opportunity attacks.
- *Headbutt:* When a creature attempts to grapple the Pitfighter or hits them with a melee attack from within 5ft, the Pitfighter can deal **8 [1d6+5]** bludgeoning damage to that creature and gain **1 Grit**.

---

**Feat - Dirty Fighting (1 Grit):** When the Pitfighter hits with a Base attack, they can spend 1 Grit to add one of the following effects:

- *Eye Gouge:* The target is blinded until the end of its next turn.
- *Low Blow:* The target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.
- *Throat Strike:* The target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components until the end of its next turn.
- *Kidney Shot:* The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll or saving throw.

**Feat - Too Tough to Die (2 Grit):** When the Pitfighter is reduced to 0 HP, they can spend 2 Grit to drop to 1 HP instead. The Pitfighter immediately gains advantage on all attacks until the end of their next turn.

**Feat - Veteran of the Pits:** The Pitfighter gains **1 Grit** whenever they take damage from an enemy attack (maximum once per enemy per round). Additionally, the Pitfighter has advantage on saving throws against being frightened and cannot be intimidated by creatures of CR equal to or lower than their own.
