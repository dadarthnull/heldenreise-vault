## Abyssal Knight

**Description:** Encased in jagged black armor that seems to absorb light itself, this warrior has embraced the darkness that others flee. Veins of crimson pulse across their plate like bleeding wounds that never heal, and their greatsword drips with shadows that writhe hungrily toward the living. They do not fight despite their pain—they fight because of it. Every drop of blood spilled nearby, friend or foe, feeds the void within them. The more the battle costs, the more terrible they become.

**Signature - Unleash Darkness (Recharge 5-6):** The Abyssal Knight releases the accumulated pain and death around them. All creatures within 20ft must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On failure, they take **35 [10d6]** necrotic damage and are frightened of the Abyssal Knight until the end of their next turn. On success, half damage and not frightened. The Abyssal Knight then gains HP equal to half the total damage dealt. This ability consumes all Dark Points and deals an additional **7 [2d6]** necrotic damage per Dark Point consumed.
