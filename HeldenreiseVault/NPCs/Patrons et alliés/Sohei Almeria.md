## Wardkeeper Crusader

**Description:** Encased in gleaming plate etched with protective sigils, this holy warrior has forsaken the sword for the sacred duty of preservation. Their hands glow with divine light, weaving barriers of pure faith between their allies and harm. They carry no weapon but a heavy tower shield emblazoned with the sun, using it not to strike but to shelter. Where they stand, death finds no purchase—their will alone turns aside blows that would fell lesser souls.

**Type:** Humanoid
**Difficulty:** 15
**Bonus:** +8
**Speed:** 25ft
**HP:** 180
**DPR:** 0 (support)
**Atk:** 2
**Dmg:** 0 per attack (grants **18** temporary HP per use)

---

**Base - Aegis of Faith:** The Crusader touches an ally within 30ft or themselves, surrounding them with a barrier of divine light. The target gains **18 [3d8+4]** temporary HP. If the target already has temporary HP from this ability, the new amount is added to the existing total (maximum **50** temporary HP from this source).

- *If targeting an ally at half HP or below:* The target also gains **+2 AC** until the start of the Crusader's next turn.
- *If targeting themselves:* The Crusader gains only half the temporary HP but can immediately use their Reaction without expending it.

---

**Signature - Divine Bulwark (Recharge 5-6):** The Crusader raises their shield and unleashes a wave of holy energy. All allies within 30ft receive the following benefits:

- Regain **30** HP.
- Gain **25** temporary HP.
- End one of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
- Gain advantage on saving throws until the start of the Crusader's next turn.

---

**Reaction - Guardian's Intervention:** Usable once per round. The Crusader chooses one:

- *Interceding Light:* When an ally within 30ft takes damage, the Crusader can grant that ally **15** temporary HP before the damage is applied.
- *Rebuke Harm:* When an ally within 30ft is hit by an attack, the Crusader can reduce the damage by **20**. The attacker takes **10** radiant damage.
- *Steadfast Presence:* When an ally within 30ft is forced to make a saving throw, the Crusader can grant that ally **+5** to the saving throw.

---

**Feat - Blessing of Might (Bonus Action):** The Crusader blesses one ally within 30ft. Until the end of that ally's next turn, their weapon attacks deal an additional **10 [2d8]** radiant damage and score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Feat - Blessing of Swiftness (Bonus Action):** The Crusader blesses one ally within 30ft. Until the end of that ally's next turn, their speed is doubled, they have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and opportunity attacks against them are made with disadvantage.

**Feat - Blessing of Resilience (Bonus Action):** The Crusader blesses one ally within 30ft. Until the end of that ally's next turn, they have resistance to all damage and cannot be moved against their will.

**Feat - Martyr's Bond:** When an ally within 30ft would be reduced to 0 HP, the Crusader can choose to take all excess damage that would have been dealt beyond 0. The ally instead drops to 1 HP and gains **20** temporary HP. This feat can be used once per short rest.
