## Primal Elementalist

**Description:** Reality bends around this mage, the very elements responding to their presence like loyal hounds. Their robes shift color with their mood—ember-red, storm-grey, ocean-blue, stone-brown—and their eyes hold the chaos of creation itself. They do not cast spells so much as commune with the fundamental forces of existence, asking fire to burn, wind to cut, water to mend, earth to crush. The elements remember the old pacts, and they answer.

**Type:** Humanoid
**Difficulty:** 16
**Bonus:** +9
**Speed:** 30ft
**HP:** 130
**DPR:** 36
**Atk:** 2
**Dmg:** 18 per attack (varies by affinity)

---

**Affinity Mechanic:** The Elementalist begins combat attuned to one element of their choice. Their current Affinity determines the effects of their Base attack, Signature ability, and grants passive benefits.

---

**Base - Elemental Invocation:** Ranged spell attack, range 120ft, one target. Effects vary by current Affinity:

- *Fire Affinity:* Deals **18 [3d8+4]** fire damage. The target ignites, taking **7 [2d6]** fire damage at the start of each of its turns (save ends). The Elementalist can move 10ft without provoking opportunity attacks after casting.
- *Air Affinity:* Deals **12 [2d8+3]** lightning damage. The Elementalist makes this attack three times instead of twice.
- *Water Affinity:* Deals **14 [2d10+3]** cold damage. An ally within 30ft of the target gains **10** temporary HP.
- *Earth Affinity:* Deals **24 [4d8+4]** bludgeoning damage. The target must make a *Strength* saving throw or be knocked prone.

---

**Signature - Elemental Cataclysm (Recharge 5-6):** The Elementalist unleashes a devastating surge of elemental power. Effects vary by current Affinity:

- *Fire Affinity — Conflagration:* All creatures in a 20ft radius within 90ft must make a *Dexterity* saving throw. On failure, they take **35 [8d8]** fire damage and ignite, taking **10 [3d6]** fire damage at the start of each turn for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On success, half damage and no ignition. The area burns for 1 minute, dealing **10 [3d6]** fire damage to any creature that enters or starts its turn there.

- *Air Affinity — Tempest Fury:* The Elementalist becomes a living storm until the end of their next turn. Their speed becomes 60ft (flying), they can move through enemy spaces, and each creature they pass within 5ft of must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or take **14 [4d6]** lightning damage. They can make four Base attacks instead of two during this time.

- *Water Affinity — Tidal Restoration:* A wave of healing water surges outward. All allies within 30ft regain **25** HP, gain **20** temporary HP, and can immediately move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, one condition of their choice is removed from each affected ally.

- *Earth Affinity — Seismic Devastation:* The Elementalist causes the ground to erupt in a 30ft cone. Creatures in the area must make a *Constitution* saving throw. On failure, they take **45 [10d8]** bludgeoning damage, are knocked prone, and have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn. On success, half damage and not knocked prone. The area becomes difficult terrain.

---

**Reaction - Elemental Reflex:** Usable once per round. The Elementalist reacts according to their current Affinity:

- *Fire Affinity — Ember Shield:* When hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes **14 [4d6]** fire damage and must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or ignite, taking **7 [2d6]** fire damage at the start of each turn (save ends).
- *Air Affinity — Gust Step:* When targeted by an attack or spell, the Elementalist can teleport 30ft to an unoccupied space. If this moves them out of range or line of sight, the attack or spell misses.
- *Water Affinity — Healing Surge:* When the Elementalist or an ally within 30ft takes damage, the damaged creature regains **15** HP after the damage is applied.
- *Earth Affinity — Stone Skin:* When the Elementalist takes damage, they reduce that damage by **20** and gain resistance to all damage until the start of their next turn.

---

**Feat - Shift Affinity (Bonus Action):** The Elementalist can change their current Affinity to a different element. When they do, they immediately gain a benefit based on the new Affinity:

- *Shifting to Fire:* The Elementalist's speed increases by 15ft until end of turn.
- *Shifting to Air:* The Elementalist can Disengage as part of this bonus action.
- *Shifting to Water:* The Elementalist gains **15** temporary HP.
- *Shifting to Earth:* The Elementalist gains **+2 AC** until the start of their next turn.

**Feat - Elemental Terrain:** As a bonus action, the Elementalist manipulates the environment in a 15ft radius centered on a point within 60ft. The effect lasts for 1 minute and varies by current Affinity:

- *Fire:* The area burns. Creatures that enter or start their turn there take **7 [2d6]** fire damage.
- *Air:* Powerful winds fill the area. Ranged attacks into, out of, or through the area have disadvantage.
- *Water:* Restorative mists fill the area. Allies that start their turn there gain **5** temporary HP.
- *Earth:* The ground becomes jagged and unstable. The area is difficult terrain, and creatures that start their turn there must make a *Dexterity* saving throw or fall prone.

**Feat - Elemental Absorption:** When the Elementalist takes damage of a type matching their current Affinity (fire, lightning, cold, or bludgeoning), they take no damage and instead regain **15** HP. This can be used once per short rest.

**Feat - Dual Attunement:** The Elementalist can maintain two Affinities simultaneously. When using their Base attack or Reaction, they choose which Affinity to use. When using their Signature ability, they can combine two Affinities, applying the effects of both (targets make saves against each separately). The Elementalist can still only change one Affinity per bonus action.
