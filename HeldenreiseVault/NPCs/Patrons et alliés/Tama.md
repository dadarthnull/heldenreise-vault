## Dawnsworn Paladin

**Description:** A towering figure in battle-scarred plate armor that gleams like polished gold even in the darkest dungeon. Their shield bears the sunburst symbol of their oath, and their longsword radiates a soft, warm light that strengthens in the presence of evil. Every wound they suffer seems to fuel their resolve rather than diminish it, divine power knitting flesh and steel alike. They stand at the front because that is where they belong—between the darkness and those who cannot defend themselves.

**Base - Consecrated Strike:** Melee weapon attack, reach 5ft, one target. Deals **17 [2d8+7]** slashing damage plus **5 [1d8]** radiant damage. If the target is undead or fiend, the radiant damage increases to **9 [2d8]**.

- *On hit:* The Paladin regains **5** HP.
- *On critical hit:* The Paladin regains **15** HP instead and the target is marked until the end of its next turn (see Feat: Sentinel's Challenge).

---

**Signature - Dawn's Embrace (Recharge 5-6):** The Paladin plants their sword into the ground and unleashes a burst of holy light. The Paladin regains **50** HP, and all enemies within 15ft must make a *Wisdom* saving throw. On failure, they take **28 [6d8]** radiant damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn. On success, they take half damage and are not blinded. Additionally, the Paladin gains **+2 AC** and advantage on all saving throws until the start of their next turn.

---

**Reaction - Bulwark of Faith:** Usable once per round. The Paladin chooses one:

- *Shield of the Faithful:* When the Paladin takes damage, they reduce that damage by **15** and regain **5** HP.
- *Retributive Smite:* When a creature within 5ft hits the Paladin with a melee attack, the Paladin can make one Base attack against that creature. If this attack hits, the Paladin regains HP equal to half the damage dealt.
- *Divine Interception:* When an ally within 5ft is targeted by an attack, the Paladin becomes the target instead and gains resistance to that attack's damage.

**Feat - Sentinel's Challenge:** As a bonus action, the Paladin marks one creature within 30ft. While marked, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than the Paladin, and the Paladin has advantage on opportunity attacks against it. If the marked creature deals damage to an ally of the Paladin, the Paladin regains **10** HP. The mark lasts for 1 minute or until the Paladin marks another creature.

**Feat - Lay on Hands:** As a bonus action, the Paladin can touch themselves or an ally within 5ft. The target regains **25** HP. Alternatively, the Paladin can expend this use to end one disease or one of the following conditions on the target: poisoned, blinded, or paralyzed. This feat can be used three times per long rest.

**Feat - Aura of Resolve:** The Paladin and all allies within 10ft have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. Additionally, when the Paladin succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, they regain **10** HP.

**Feat - Undying Conviction:** When the Paladin is reduced to 0 HP for the first time in combat, they immediately drop to 1 HP instead, regain **30** HP, and can make one Base attack against a creature within reach. This feat recharges after a long rest.
